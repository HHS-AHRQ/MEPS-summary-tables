Starting in 2002, specifications changed so that individuals could report multiple races. Respondents were asked if the race of the sample person was best described as American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, black, white, or other. Prior to 2002, race categories in the tables for American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, multiple races, white, and other are collapsed into the single category of <i>White and other<\/i>.<\/p>\n\n<p>For all years, respondents were asked if the sample person's main national origin or ancestry was Puerto Rican; Cuban; Mexican, Mexicano, Mexican American, or Chicano; other Latin American; or other Spanish. All persons whose main national origin or ancestry was reported in one of these Hispanic groups, regardless of racial background, are classified as Hispanic. Since the Hispanic grouping can include black Hispanic, white Hispanic, and other Hispanic, the race categories of black, white, and other do not include Hispanic people.<\/p>\n"};
