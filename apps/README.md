## apps

These R codes are needed to run the tables on your local computer (no external server access is needed).

Prior to running these codes, [download and install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Then, install and load the Shiny package using the following code:
```
install.packages("shiny")
library(shiny)
```

Open the R programs in RStudio, highlight the code and click **Run** or **Run App** (if available). Only one Shiny program can be run at a time in RStudio. Note that local links in the navigation bar will not work as expected when using Shiny to run the tables (an external server is needed).
